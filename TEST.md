| The patent US20220035083A1 describes a spatial frequency filter device for use with a laser beam. The device includes a neutral region configured to transmit or reflect the laser beam and a deflecting region radially adjoining the neutral region, designed to deflect beam components of the laser beam from its beam axis. The deflecting region has a constant portion, where the deflecting effect on the beam components is independent of a location's distance from the neutral region, and a variation portion, where the deflecting effect varies depending on a location's distance from the neutral region. The device can reliably and effectively deflect undesired beam components, enabling filtering of these components whether they are separated from or close to the main beam. This solution addresses difficulties in filtering undesired beam components that overlap with the main beam&#8203;``oaicite:{"number":1,"metadata":{"title":"patents.google.com","url":"https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220035083A1/en?oq=US20220035083A1","text":"Abstract\n\nA spatial frequency filter device is for use with a laser beam.
